## Netflix Subscriptions Forecasting
This project aims to forecast Netflix subscription growth using historical data and advanced time series analysis techniques. By accurately predicting future subscription counts, Netflix can make informed decisions on strategic planning, marketing, and resource allocation to optimize subscriber growth.

## Project Overview
-- The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Historical Netflix subscription data was gathered and cleaned to enhance data quality, ensuring accurate forecasting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Time series patterns, trends, and seasonality were explored to understand the key factors influencing subscription growth.
Model Development: Implemented ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast future subscriptions. Both models were trained and optimized to achieve high accuracy.
Model Evaluation: The ARIMA and LSTM models were evaluated based on forecasting accuracy metrics, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 8% and an overall forecasting accuracy of 92%.
Business Impact: The forecasting results provide valuable insights into potential growth, helping Netflix strategize effectively for future subscriber acquisition.
## Results
The ARIMA model provided a reliable baseline forecast with interpretable results.
The LSTM model, leveraging deep learning, captured complex patterns and improved forecast accuracy.
The final model achieved a 92% accuracy rate, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities for Netflix's subscription growth.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of time series forecasting in a real-world scenario, providing actionable insights for business strategy and planning. The models developed offer a robust tool for predicting Netflix's future subscriber trends, supporting data-driven decision-making.
